# Papers and talks
This page contains links to some of the talks I have have given, papers I have been involved in and other materials I have written over the years.

## My PhD thesis
"Experimental Data Analysis Techniques for Validation of Tokamak Impurity Transport Simulations." Check out the [full document]({{ github.site.url }}/pdfs/thesis.pdf), my [thesis defense slides]({{ github.site.url }}/pdfs/thesis_defense_slides_chilenski.pdf), and the [source code for all of my analysis](https://github.com/markchil/thesiscode).
(The emoticons in the slides are a reference to Prof. Jeff Freidberg's famous recurring question "Does this result make you happy or sad?")

## Conference talks and posters
[Reassessment of impurity transport coefficients in Alcator C-Mod]({{ site.github.url }}/pdfs/APS_2016_Talk_Chilenski.pdf): A talk presented at the 2016 American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics conference in San Jose, CA.

[Investigation of core impurity transport in Alcator C-Mod EDA H-mode plasmas]({{ site.github.url }}/pdfs/TTF_2013_Poster_Chilenski.pdf): A poster presented at the 2013 Transport Task Force workshop in Santa Rosa, CA. Describes experimental observations of how impurity particles move in high-performance magnetically confined plasmas and shows initial work on profile fitting which ultimately led to the decision to use non-stationary Gaussian processes to infer plasma profiles.

[Investigation of impurity transport in Alcator C-Mod using laser blow-off impurity injection]({{ site.github.url }}/pdfs/APS_2012_Poster_Chilenski.pdf): A poster presented at the 2012 American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics conference in Providence, RI.
