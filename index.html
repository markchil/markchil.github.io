    <h1>Plasma physicist and data analysis tool-builder</h1>
    <p>I am a PhD student at MIT working on questions of data analysis related to plasma physics and nuclear fusion. I am excited by building general-purpose data analysis tools which help both my research and that of others.</p>
    
    <h2>Nuclear fusion and plasma physics research</h2>
    <p>At MIT I work on the <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/topics/alcator-c-mod-tokamak">Alcator C-Mod tokamak</a>. This is a device which makes an artificial star (specifically, a doughnut-shaped mass of superheated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)">plasma</a>), held in place with magnetic fields. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to harness the energy released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">nuclear fusion</a> to make power plants which can supply large amounts of clean, safe energy around the clock. While we have been able to magnetically confine plasmas hot enough to produce the desired fusion reactions for many years, the goal of having a reactor which produces more energy than it consumes has so far eluded us. Because the loss of energy from the plasma is a convective-diffusive process, making the reactor bigger is the most obvious way to slow the rate at which the plasma cools down. But, this means that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER">next-generation experiment presently under construction</a> is one of the most expensive scientific projects ever undertaken. In order to move forward in an economical manner, we need to develop simulation codes which let us model a proposed reactor in order to characterize and optimize its design without having to spend billions of dollars on a new facility.</p>
    
    <h2>My PhD research</h2>
    <p>My current research involves bringing cutting-edge statistical tools to bear on questions of data analysis and instrumentation in order to make measurements which allow us to benchmark such simulation codes against what happens in real experiments. There are two main thrusts of my PhD research:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Inferring plasma profiles:</b> The confined plasma has high temperature (exceeding that of the Sun!) in the center, tapering to essentially room temperature at the wall. Likewise, there is high density in the center, tapering to a near-perfect vacuum outside of the confined plasma. The gradients of these temperature and density profiles drive the turbulence which causes the plasma to cool down. Therefore, the profile gradients are critical inputs for the simulation codes which we are trying to benchmark. But, there are no instruments which can directly sense the profile gradients: we must take local measurements of the profile and, combined with an appropriate prior distribution, infer the profile gradients. I have pioneered the use of non-stationary <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/">Gaussian process regression (GPR)</a> combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</a> sampling of the hyperparameters to infer plasma profile gradients complete with statistically-rigorous uncertainty estimates. This work culminated in the development of my <a href="http://gptools.readthedocs.io">gptools</a> and <a href="http://profiletools.readthedocs.io">profiletools</a> software.</li>
        <li><p><b>Inferring impurity transport coefficients:</b> Because of their different masses and charges, impurity particles (i.e., particles which are not the fuel the bulk plasma is composed of) behave differently than the bulk plasma. These differences can have critical implications for the viability of high-performance confinement regimes, and can offer an additional channel to benchmark plasma simulations with. In order to measure the behavior of impurities in Alcator C-Mod we use a laser to propell a controlled amount of an impurity into the plasma. We can then track how the impurity moves using x-ray spectroscopy and soft x-ray tomography. This use of an impurity injected into the plasma is somewhat akin to the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry">particle image velocimetry (PIV)</a> in the study of fluids.</p>
            <p>Given our measurements of how the injected impurities move, we then want to infer what the diffusive and convective components of the flow are so that we can compare these quantities to theoretical and computational predictions. This is a difficult nonlinear inverse problem, which requires very careful selection of basis functions/prior distribution and very powerful inference tools such as <a href="https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/">MultiNest</a>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>My interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data analysis, machine learning, statistics and Bayesian inference:</b> I am very passionate about data analysis and getting the statistics right &ndash; everything in science is garbage in, garbage out. So, if we do not do it right, we will just end up fooling ourselves and making poor decisions.</li>
        <li><b>Instrumentation:</b> Without the right data coming in, no amount of clever statistics will save you. Therefore I am very interested in working with the latest technologies and building statistical models which can incorporate all of the data which are being collected.</li>
        <li><b>Tool-building:</b> Much of the analysis I do can be applied to many domains. By writing good code, the tools I make can be used to make progress in many fields. The fact that what I am doing can help people working in many fields inspires me to do what I do as best as I can.</li>
    </ul>
